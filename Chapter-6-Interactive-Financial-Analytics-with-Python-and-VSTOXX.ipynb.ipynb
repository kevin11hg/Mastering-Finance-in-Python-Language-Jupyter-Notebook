    "Investors use volatility derivatives to diversify and hedge their risk in equity and credit portfolios. Since long-term investors in equity funds are exposed to downside risk, volatility can be used as a hedge for the tail risk and replacement for the put options. In the US, the <b>Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX)</b> measures the short-term volatility implied by the S&P 500 stock index option prices. Many people around the world use the VIX to measure the stock market volatility over the next 30-day period. In Europe, the <b>EURO STOXX 50 Volatility (VSTOXX) </b> market index is based on the market prices of a basket of <b>Euro STOXX 50 Index Options (OESX)</b> nd measures th eimplied market volatility over the next 30 day s on the EURO STOXX 50 Index\n",

    "For benchmark strategies utilizing the EURO STOXX 50 Index, the nature of its negative correlation with the VSTOXX presents a viable way of avoiding benchmark-rebalancing costs. The statistical nature of volatility allows traders to perform mean-reverting strategies, dispersion trading, and volatility spread trading, among others.\n",
